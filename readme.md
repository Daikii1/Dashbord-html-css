I'm currently working on enhancing my learning journey by creating a dashboard using HTML and CSS. I'm following the tutorials provided by Elzero Web School channel to improve my skills in web development. This dashboard project is a part of my ongoing efforts to apply the concepts I've learned and to further solidify my understanding of web design and styling. The guidance from Elzero Web School is proving to be invaluable in shaping my progress, and I look forward to refining my skills through this hands-on experience.
